          PWDs or Persons with disabilities are those who have physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments that are long term according to the Department of Health of the Philippines. These impairments prevent them from being on equal ground with the rest of society. Because of their conditions, they lose a lot of opportunities and are unable to do a lot of things that a normal person would be able to do like being able to work jobs. <b>They consist of around 15% of the population</b> of the whole world which is equivalent to over 1 billion people.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          In the Philippine context, working towards removing the barrier that PWDs experience in society isn’t being given focus. Instead of being helped and given more opportunities, these PWDs are put in a tougher position especially since COVID-19 has made jobs less accessible, needing more digital skills for working from home. This gave the PWDs, who in the first place had a challenge of finding jobs already pre-pandemic, a greater disadvantage since they had to know and be able to use devices and the internet which is also challenging for them with their disabilities.        </p>

        <p><br>
          Education has always been one of the most important sectors of Philippine society. An in-person setup would allow for teachers to address and identify problems with lesson plans and teaching methods in a quick manner. Students would be able to form connections with both classmates and teachers, and slowly learn independence. (Francia et al., 2021). However, when the pandemic struck the country, not only did it reveal the lacking capacity to maintain itself but also demonstrated that the entire system was lagging behind.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          Summed up by UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov, “In 2020, schools globally were fully closed for an average of <b>79 teaching days</b>, while the Philippines has been closed for <b>more than a year…</b> The associated consequences of school closures – learning loss, mental distress, missed vaccinations, and heightened risk of drop out, child labour, and child marriage – will be felt by many children, especially the youngest learners in critical development stages.” The already-present matter of an education crisis was exacerbated by widening the gap between teacher and student and placing a digital wall between these two.        </p>

        <p><br>
          Women and the elderly are both demographics in our society that are marginalized in certain aspects, one such being in the digital world. According to UNICEF, women have lower levels of income which often means that they cannot afford mobile or internet sources. Other factors include lower network coverage in rural areas and fewer options for data plans and SIMs. Aside from the lower average income, women are more price-sensitive and may consider gadgets and the internet unneeded in comparison to basic needs.</p>
        <p style="text-align-last: right; -moz-text-align-last: right;"><br>
          For elderly people, technology can seem brand new, yet challenging and hard to understand. In the Philippines, only 36% of the elderly population uses the internet (Pew Research Center, 2020). Especially in the Philippines where internet access is already limited for the average person and there is a great digital divide between our country and the rest of the world, the digital wall for these marginalized groups is growing taller and taller.
